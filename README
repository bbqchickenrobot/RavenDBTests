Test kept on Github with a fix in place for other users who may have had the same issue.

*****************

This test, given some setup within the environment, will show how RavenDB has slow releases of sockets, causing potential socket overloads on servers.

Required Setup:

Windows Authentication on RavenDB Server

Limited set of ports available to verify crash

- netsh int ipv4 set dynamicport tcp start=1025 num=4475

While the test is running, netstat -a can be run to see the ports left in a TIME_WAIT state instead of being recycled
